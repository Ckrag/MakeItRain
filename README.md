MakeItRain
==========

A webapplication for a rain of images.

The user sets settings and adds image links and the application then creates a rain of images.
The URL can be shared with others, though at the moment it's a very ugly and long GET.

Running example can be found here: http://clauskrag.com/projects/rain/
